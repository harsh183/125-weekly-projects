<p>
    We're a group of CS 125 staff who want to pass on our knowledge. Giving people a set of fun and
     useful experiences over the summer. 
</p>

<p>This is an entirely volunteer based initiative for the covid19 times, and we're welcoming of all
     (good or bad) feedback at the <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/">Course Forum</a>.
