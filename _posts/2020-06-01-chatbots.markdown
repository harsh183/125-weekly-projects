With the pandemic we all started using chat more than ever before for our families, friends, classes and even work. What if we could make cool bots we could show off to people and make it do something useful? A Facebook bot for your store, a Discord bot for your friends or a Slack bot for your clubs and jobs. The possibilities are endless.

If you've never done Python before, here is a start. Coming from Java or C++, this can seem almost underwhelming but Python allows you do to so many of the same things with a lot less work. This does have disadvantages, but this trait of python makes it an ideal language for trying new ideas and iterating on them quickly.

```python
print("Hello Chatbots")
```

## Motivation

[Introduction to Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/intro.html) - this is honestly advice I feel everyone new to CS should read and follow.

## Tools

* Micro

* Github

## Setup

I will expect this part is done before the workshop, but don't worry if you're not done since we're recording everything and all the material is there as text on the website too.

1. If you're on Windows I *highly* reccomend getting WSL2 (WSL 1 is also fine but slower). For historical reasons, the command line in Windows is just not as good as Mac or Linux. Eventually they just said, "Hey what if we had full* Linux *on* Windows."

2. Install a recent version of Python (3.7+) on your computer and make sure to enable `pip` as well. <!-- TODO: Add more detail from web bot workshop maybe --> 

3. Set up the `micro` text editor or other command line text editor of choice. See the page I wrote for [micro](/micro) for more detailed instructions.
