Automation is fun! What if we could do fancy stuff through automation with the web browser?

```python

## Motivation

[On the Subject of Talent](https://drawabox.com/article/talent) - this is advice for artists, but in my experience, a lot of good art advice also applies to programming. We are more alike than a lot of people realize.

## Workshop

* cs 225 slide+notes downloader (though can be adapted to basically any course) - use similar approaches for any of your classes
* we start at home page
* we extract and find the lecture button url
* we request that
* for each week we create a folder called `week<n>` where n is 1.16
* we get the date we save `<date>_slides.pdf` and `<date>_handout.pdf` where date is what we scraped


## Learn more

* wacky web bots thing

* scrapy

* testing + web browser stuff
