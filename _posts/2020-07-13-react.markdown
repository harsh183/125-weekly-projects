Now we complete two halves of a whole using `React` to create a basic frontend.

```ts
console.log("Hello React");
```

Hosted by: Harsh Deep

## Motivation

[The 50% rule](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/2/50percent) - also good artist advice

> at least half of the time you spend drawing must be devoted to drawing purely for its own sake. Not to learn, not to improve, not to develop your skills, not even to apply what you've already learned. There are no restrictions on medium, no specific techniques you must use, no subject matter you must focus on.

## Setup

All you need is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Check to see if you have the latest version installed on your device by typing ``node -v`` on your terminal. This will let us install everything we need.

## Workshop



## Learn more

* General web development - [Freecodemcamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn), this covers html, css, js, frameworks like react, data visualization and a lot more. It's a very extensive cirriculum which will teach a _lot_.

* General react [Offical intro](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#making-an-interactive-component). This also covers react `class` syntax that is regarded as old, but seen a lot in practice. For this workshop, I tried to focus on what's relevant.

* React Hooks - [Official intro](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), [Simple Todo list tutorial](https://www.educative.io/blog/react-hooks-tutorial-todo-list), [Educative Course series](https://www.educative.io/courses/road-to-react-with-hooks)

* Interacting with web APIs with `axios` - [digital ocean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-axios-react)

* TypeScript - [Typescript in 5 minutes from OOP](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-oop.htmlb), [TypeScript from scratch](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html), and [React with Typescript - educative](https://www.educative.io/blog/react-and-typescript)

## Ideas

* Some interesting frontend that has some dynamic content. 

* Try to make it in a way that the user never has to reload. 

* Hook in some API and do something interesting.

* Create something that has live update mechanisms. That's always interesting to work with.

* See if you can add Typescript in interesting ways. This is more 

## Requirements

* You should show it off in your README.md file, with animations/video and an explanation of the game.

* Has to use a Open Source license via a `LICENSE` file
