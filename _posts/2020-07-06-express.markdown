Any website has two parts: a frontend and a backend. The backend handles our logic and data storage and communciates via URLs, but instead of sending web pages, it only sends data.

Now, let's create something simple with `Express` to show a basic backend service in action.

```ts
console.log("Hello express");
```

## Motivation

[Hackers and Painters](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) - A bit old, but perhaps my favorite essay of all time on the nature of CS and how we work. This essay portrays computer science as creative work rather than the typical connection to applied math, science or engineering. It's a long essay but definitely worth revisiting every few months. Also, it was written by one of the most iconic people in the tech startup space for starting YCombinator, Paul Graham.
