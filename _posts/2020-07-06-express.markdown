Any website has two parts: a frontend and a backend. The backend handles our logic and data storage and communciates via URLs, but instead of sending web pages, it only sends data.

Now, let's create something simple with `Express` to show a basic backend service in action.

```ts
console.log("Hello express");
```

## Motivation

[Hackers and Painters](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) - A bit old, but perhaps my favorite essay of all time on the nature of CS and how we work. This essay portrays computer science as creative work rather than the typical connection to applied math, science or engineering. It's a long essay but definitely worth revisiting every few months. Also, it was written by one of the most iconic people in the tech startup space for starting YCombinator, Paul Graham.

## Setup

1. Install and set up [Postman](http://postman.com/). This lets us interact with and test our web API, and is one of the most popular tools for Bakcend Developers today.

2. Install NodeJS either via a [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) (OSX, Linux, WSL) or [installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). To verify this installed right run `$ node --version` and `$ npm --version` and if both work, you're good.

3. Clone the starter [repo](https://github.com/mpara0/express-workshop) with `$ git clone git@github.com:mpara0/express-workshop.git`

4. `$ cd express-workshop` and run `$ npm install`. This should install `express.js` which is the framework we're using to create our backend.

## International Community of Open Source

FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) initially started in the West Coast of the US, but grew to encompass projects and contributors from all over the world. A lot of the commercial software out there today is still mostly limited to a narrow set of countries, but open source software doesn't have to deal with immigration restrictions. Entire communities of software developers from Africa, South America, East Asia, East Europe and more are able to contribute to open source software making is a very global concept. Many country's are even starting [to make laws](https://fossbytes.com/world-open-source-map-which-countries-have-open-source-laws/) to boost open source contribution. Check out some of the [contribution data](https://hoffa.medium.com/github-top-countries-201608-13f642493773) here.

## Requirements

* You should show it off in your README.md file, with animations/video and an explanation of the game.
<!-- Game? -->
* Has to use a Open Source license via a `LICENSE` file
