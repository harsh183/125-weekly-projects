Many people got into CS by playing video games and wanting to make more. Even if you didn't, learning how to make something simple and fun is quite rewarding and nice to show off to other people.

```python
print("Hello pygame!")
```

## Motivation

* Comic: [IRA GLASS: Advice for beginners](http://www.zenpencils.com/comic/90-ira-glass-advice-for-beginners/)

## Install

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Learn more

* [Geeks for Geeks: Introduction to pygame](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-pygame/) - a simple intro for getting started. They have 2-3 other articles that are worth checking out as well.

* [Real Python: PyGame: A Primer on Game Programming in Python](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/) - an extensive intro to pygame.

* Pygame official examples [code](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/tree/main/examples) and [documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/examples.html) - here are a lot of sample games and their code. Some might be simpler than others. You can run all of them, poke around their code, and even modify it to understand how things work. Some of this stuff can be advanced, but it's a great way to learn. 

## Ideas

Feel free to come up with anything you want as long as it's chatbot related. Here are some ideas to help you get started, but feel free to come up with more. Don't worry if it's already been done or if someone else is doing it. The point is learning and fun. :)

* What kind of games do you like to play? Could you make a simplified version of one of them?

* Were there any examples that you found interesting? Could you recreate some of that functionality on your own (without copying, of course)?

## Requirements

* It should use pygame.

* You should show it off in your README.md file, with animations/video and an explanation of the game.
